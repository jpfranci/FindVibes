Spotify song recommender that creates a personalized private playlist for users and serves as a visualization tool for each recommended song. Users can configure which time range to look at to create their playlist and also what to use for their recommendations, whether it be their top artists or top songs or both, and how many of these tops to use for their recommended playlist.

Each song has 30 second previews of its chorus and expands to show its artist's top songs with options to add those songs onto the playlist. Links for the album and song, even the artist's top songs are also included in each row of the table and the table itself can be easily sorted by popularity, song name, artist name, or randomly.
